# Expenso

This is my first app built in deno/fresh. It's my attempt of creating the
expense tracker app I always wanted and never found.

### Usage

Make sure to install Deno: https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation

Then copy the `.env.example` to `.env` and fill the necessary values. e.g.

```
ENVIRONMENT=dev
DENO_KV_PATH=sqlite
RESEND_API_KEY=re_*
```

You're good to start the project:

```
deno task start
```

This will watch the project directory and restart as necessary.
