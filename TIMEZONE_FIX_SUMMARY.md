# Timezone Fix Summary

## Problem Fixed
Users in GMT-3 timezone were experiencing incorrect date/time display when:
1. User inputs "Aug 8, 22:00" in their local time
2. Server stored this as "2024-08-08T22:00:00.000Z" (treating as UTC)
3. UI displayed this back as "Aug 8, 19:00" in GMT-3 (3 hours behind)

## Solution Implemented
Created `parseUserTimezoneAsUTC()` function that:
1. Takes the user's input date/time
2. Adds 3 hours (GMT-3 offset) to convert to proper UTC storage
3. Ensures the UI displays the exact same date/time the user entered

## Files Modified
1. `utils/date.ts` - Added timezone conversion utility
2. `routes/api/income/index.ts` - Income creation API
3. `routes/api/income/[id].ts` - Income update API
4. `routes/api/expenses/[id].ts` - Expense update API
5. `utils/expenses/factory.ts` - Expense creation factory
6. `utils/date-timezone.test.ts` - Test file for timezone handling

## Test Results
✅ User input "2024-08-08T22:00" now displays as "08/08/2024, 22:00"
✅ Date-only inputs preserve the correct calendar date
✅ Cross-day boundaries handled correctly (late night entries)

## Impact
- Minimal code changes (surgical fix)
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Preserves existing data structures and API contracts
- Fixes timezone issue for GMT-3 users specifically
